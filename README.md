### Automatic Labeling of Dermoscopy Images of Melanoma and Benign Keratosis-like Lesions Using Weak Supervision

**Abstract**
 State-of-the art supervised learning techniques require extensive collections of manually labeled training data. Such process of hand-labeling is notably time-consuming and costly especially when technical domain expertise is required. Which poses a significant hurdle in acquiring labeled datasets. The HAM1000 dataset, a part of the largest skin image challenge hosted by the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) during the 2018 MICCAI conference boasts a vast repository of 10015 dermoscopic images motivating research in generating segmentations and classification submissions. Our work innovates within this domain, suggesting an approach to automatically label melanoma and benign keratosis-like lesions programmatically  through weak supervision, representing a novel exploration in skin imaging research that showcase potential advancements in automated labeling of medical imaging data.
